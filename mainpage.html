    <p>Please be aware that I have not played every single Resident Evil video game. As such, the Semi-Canonical RE0 or the Now Confirmed 100% Canon (by the trailer of RE9) Outbreak Files will not be detailed here.</p>
    <p>...Which means this is ONLY mainline. Apart from RE7. and 8. And 9 (<-- It didn't release yet, as of writing this). I refuse to play the newer games because of Chris Redfield being horribly mischaracterized. Sorry, not sorry.</p>
    <p>Oh also the recaps I'm writing here skip over some plot elements. Veterans will see I haven't mentioned Lisa Trevor in my RE1 summary. That's because I'm here to recap the general plot, not every in-depth nook and cranny.</p>
    <p>If you want the full experience, play the games yourself!</p>

<h2>The Night Between July 24th and 25th; Resident Evil 1.</h2>
<p>The first game follows the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team members:
Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield (The two protagonists), Barry Burton and Albert Wesker.
They were supposed to search the forest for potential cannibals/cultist, as killings occured near those woods that looked like the victims were eaten.
They are however chased into a mansion inside the forest by zombie dogs (Cerberi).
The mansion, belonging to Oswald Spencer (The mansion is named the Spencer Mansion. Not to be confused with the Spencer Estate. That's a whole different building.) houses lots of zombies (zombified scientists, infected by the T Virus) and the aforementioned Cerberi.
Depending on who you choose to play as:</p>
<p>-In Jill's case, You enter the mansion with Barry, Wesker and Chris. Chris is later locked up in the basement. You can save him, which is required to getting the best ending.</p>
<p>-In Chris' case, it's Jill and Wesker with you. Barry is implied dead in this route.</p>
<br>
<p>The team (sans Wesker) (And in Chris' case, sans Jill because she's also locked up) Makes their way deeper inside the basement.
If Chris is chosen, he meets Rebecca Chambers, a STARS Bravo team member, and a wounded Richard Aikens. No matter what you do, Aikens dies.
If Jill is chosen, she DOESN'T meet Rebecca. She instead discovers Barry may be a traitor, as he seems to be hiding something...
...Which is that Wesker has his entire family hostage and will kill them if he doesn't follow his orders. Yup, Wesker is a traitor.
Anyways, in the basement Chris+Rebecca/Jill+Barry confront Wesker, who unleashes Tyrant. A B.O.W. (Bio-Organic Weapon) that was infected... ALSO WITH THE T VIRUS.
The T-Virus works a bit like this:
If you have the right genes (I'm not making this up), the T virus can turn you into different things:</p>
<p>-A demigod, basically (In Wesker's case)</p>
<p>-Tyrant or other B.O.W.</p>
<p>If you don't, you're a zombie.</p>
<p>The T-virus was originally developed as a weapon, the goal of its project being to create a B.O.W. and sell it.</p>
<p>the S.T.A.R.S. members were lured into the Spencer Mansion so that the Tyrant could collect combat data from fighting with them. Wesker would have killed 2 birds with one stone.</p>
<p>So the Tyrant is set free, and the first thing it does is STAB WESKER with its weird arm.
(Wesker survives this, by the way!)
Anyhoo, the team fights out of the basement, goes up onto the helipad, and signals the pilot of the helicopter (Brad, who was there the whole time) to pick them up.
They have one last showdown againtst Tyrant, and they blow it up with what will later become the classic RE boss finisher: A well-timed RPG.</p>
<br>
<h2>So... which route is canon?</h2>
<p>None of them are. While RE1 does canonically happen, all of the companion characters from both routes are confirmed alive later in the series. Apart from Aikens. RIP Aikens.</p>

<div id="RE23">
Jill is in her apartment, pretty shocked after the events of the mansion (Which transpired months ago), When Nemesis bursts through her apartment wall and tries to kill her. She escapes and meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. member Brad (He was the helicopter pilot in RE1)
Brad dies and is zombified. Jill is saved from Nemesis by a guy from Umbrella's Rescue Force (Consisting of unknowing convicts. Theyre supposed to be like "Nooo aha we did not cause the outbreak aha look were helping") named Carlos Oliveira. He helps Jill escape but uh oh! There's a traitor! Nicholai doesnt like the fact theyre trying to help a soul who is actively being hunted by Nemesis, he betrays his comrades, leaving them for certain death.
Of course Jill and Carlos survive.
Claire Redfield, you may recognize that last name, yes, that's Chris' sister, is trying to seek out her brother. She comes over to Racoon City to meet him but WHOOPS! Zombies!
Leon Scott Kennedy is a rookie cop who asked to be positioned in RCPD (Raccoon City Police Department), but when he gets there, WHOOPS! Zombies!
Anyhoo, he and Claire meet, then get separated. Hold on Im gonna vontinue this in a moment
So Claire finds Sherry Birkin, a young child. She later meets Ms. Annette Birkin, her mother, who is trying to stop the now Mutated William Birkin.
Claire also meets a corrupt Chief of Police, Irons.
Irons basically wants Sherry's pendant because it's a key to acquiring a vaccine to the G virus or... I dont actually remember that well but it was probably the G virus.
Claire witnesses Irons get killed by G-002 (iirc?) (Thats still Birkin btw just another mutation)
She manages to secure Sherry and bring her to her mother.
MEANWHILE Leon finds FBI Agent Ada Wong and... I actually forgot what that guys name is (Hey its future Glitchy! That guys name is Ben) but he locked himself in a cell to stay away from the zombies
Ada Wong, is NOT actually FBI. She's here for the G virus vaccine but falls in love with Leon enough to help him.
He doesnt find this out until later.
For now, lets focus on this huge gray guy with a tophat. Who's that? That's Mr. X, one of the BOWs that were released into the streets of Raccoon city to get rid of the survivors, which might learn an uncomfortable truth (That Umbrella was behind all this).
Anyhoo, Mr. X kills Ben and follows Leon and Ada into the underground lab called NEST, where Claire, Annette and Sherry are.
Sherry is still with Claire at this point, so Ada tries to interrogate Annette, asking her where the virus sample is. She fails and has to be saved by Leon.
Okay so this is where the paths between the protagonists intertwine.
G-003 infects Sherry with the G virus. Claire takes the antidote using her pendant and saves her. The way to the virus samples is now unlocked because of Claire using the pendant. Leon, sent by Ada, takes the sample while Claire gives the antidote to Sherry, healing her.
Leon FINALLY discovers Ada was not actually FBI. She was gonna sell the G virus.
(Now, the remake wants you to think Ada gets shot by Annette, falls into the abyss and somehow survives. But that is NOT CANON, as proven by the Wii game and COMMON SENSE. Here's what ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO ADA:) She gets ambushed by Mr. X and "dies".
Leon takes the virus sample (iirc?) and has to escape the underground lab because wuh oh! Its gonna blow!
Okay so while Leon was doing all that Claire takes Sherry to this underground Laboratory Evacuation train. She fights G-004 next to it and manages to escape.
While she's fighting G-004, Leon fights Mr. X, who is now dubbed Super Tyrant because one of his internal machines burnt down.
Ada, still alive, tosses him a staple of the franchise - A well timed RPG. He manages to kill the super tyrant and catch the train Claire is on.
On the train, G-005 appears and starts overtaking one of the train cars. One of the protagonists fights it off and detatches the car, leaving William to die in the explosion.
If you're wondering what happened to Annette, she's dead via G-004 when he first appears. Forgot to tell you that.
And that's how RE2 ends; Sherry, Claire and Leon escape. Leon thinks Ada is dead (She isnt) but all is well
ONTO... the second half of RE3!
So Jill, thanks to Nemesis' attack, is infected with the T virus! Carlos has to find a vaccine. And he does, inside a hospital in Raccoon City.
Basically he got it from this guy named Nathaniel Bard. Who is currently dead but he wasn't like an hour ago. Also Carlos was actually supposed to rescue him.
He brings the vaccine to Jill and she recovers. But WUH OH. They're planning to NUKE RACCOON CITY. (<-- Deconfirmed by RE9 and RE Outbreak. They actually planned to use missiles. Not nuclear. Just missiles.)
They go searching for more vaccines, to try and maybe call off the bombing, and eventually find them. They're supposed to deliver them to someone who will be arriving to their location but whoops! Nicholai is like "Nuh uh" and breaks it!
He is left behind as Raccoon City is bombed and Jill + Carlos escape onboard a helicopter.
