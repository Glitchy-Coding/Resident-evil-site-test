    <p>Please be aware that I have not played every single Resident Evil video game. As such, the Semi-Canonical RE0 or the Now Confirmed 100% Canon (by the trailer of RE9) Outbreak Files will not be detailed here.</p>
    <p>...Which means this is ONLY mainline. Apart from RE7. and 8. And 9 (<-- It didn't release yet, as of writing this). I refuse to play the newer games because of Chris Redfield being horribly mischaracterized. Sorry, not sorry.</p>
    <p>Oh also the recaps I'm writing here skip over some plot elements. Veterans will see I haven't mentioned Lisa Trevor in my RE1 summary. That's because I'm here to recap the general plot, not every in-depth nook and cranny.</p>
    <p>If you want the full experience, play the games yourself!</p>

<h2>The Night Between July 24th and 25th; Resident Evil 1.</h2>
<p>The first game follows the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team members:
Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield (The two protagonists), Barry Burton and Albert Wesker.
They were supposed to search the forest for potential cannibals/cultist, as killings occured near those woods that looked like the victims were eaten.
They are however chased into a mansion inside the forest by zombie dogs (Cerberi).
The mansion, belonging to Oswald Spencer (The mansion is named the Spencer Mansion. Not to be confused with the Spencer Estate. That's a whole different building.) houses lots of zombies (zombified scientists, infected by the T Virus) and the aforementioned Cerberi.
Depending on who you choose to play as:</p>
<p>-In Jill's case, You enter the mansion with Barry, Wesker and Chris. Chris is later locked up in the basement. You can save him, which is required to getting the best ending.</p>
<p>-In Chris' case, it's Jill and Wesker with you. Barry is implied dead in this route.</p>
<br>
<p>The team (sans Wesker) (And in Chris' case, sans Jill because she's also locked up) Makes their way deeper inside the basement.
If Chris is chosen, he meets Rebecca Chambers, a STARS Bravo team member, and a wounded Richard Aikens. No matter what you do, Aikens dies.
If Jill is chosen, she DOESN'T meet Rebecca. She instead discovers Barry may be a traitor, as he seems to be hiding something...
...Which is that Wesker has his entire family hostage and will kill them if he doesn't follow his orders. Yup, Wesker is a traitor.
Anyways, in the basement Chris+Rebecca/Jill+Barry confront Wesker, who unleashes Tyrant. A B.O.W. (Bio-Organic Weapon) that was infected... ALSO WITH THE T VIRUS.
The T-Virus works a bit like this:
If you have the right genes (I'm not making this up), the T virus can turn you into different things:</p>
<p>-A demigod, basically (In Wesker's case)</p>
<p>-Tyrant or other B.O.W.</p>
<p>If you don't, you're a zombie.</p>
<p>The T-virus was originally developed as a weapon, the goal of its project being to create a B.O.W. and sell it.</p>
<p>the S.T.A.R.S. members were lured into the Spencer Mansion so that the Tyrant could collect combat data from fighting with them. Wesker would have killed 2 birds with one stone.</p>
<p>So the Tyrant is set free, and the first thing it does is STAB WESKER with its weird arm.
(Wesker survives this, by the way!)
Anyhoo, the team fights out of the basement, goes up onto the helipad, and signals the pilot of the helicopter (Brad, who was there the whole time) to pick them up.
They have one last showdown againtst Tyrant, and they blow it up with what will later become the classic RE boss finisher: A well-timed RPG.</p>
<br>
<h2>So... which route is canon?</h2>
<p>None of them are. While RE1 does canonically happen, all of the companion characters from both routes are confirmed alive later in the series. Apart from Aikens. RIP Aikens.</p>
